 <br>
Large language model(LLM) will profoundly impact learning and education. As a new technological tool, it will reduce the marginal cost of one-on-one tutoring toward nearly zero. 
<br>
On the other hand, while liberating humans from certain knowledge tasks, it may prompt a reevaluation of our self-worth and a shift in the focus and scope of human education.
<br>
The following research directions are pivotal in addressing the changes brought by LLM in education and leveraging the opportunities:
<br>
1. Empowering Education with LLM: Harness the interdisciplinary knowledge, strong linguistic interaction, and low marginal cost inherent in LLM, address the lack of subject-matter expertise, content controllability, and quality consistency in LLM to support the adoption, recognition, and democratization of core competency education.
<br>
2. AI Computational Thinking Education: Assist individuals and organizations in understanding the capabilities and limitations of LLM. Pinpoint the roles and responsibilities in human-model collaboration. By abstracting and breaking down problems, designing and validating processes, and iterating based on feedback, we can harness LLM to solve existing issues or create new value.
