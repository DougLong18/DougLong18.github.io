 <br>
Large language model(LLM) will profoundly impact learning and education. As a new technological tool, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJP5GqnTrNo">it will reduce the marginal cost of one-on-one tutoring toward nearly zero.</a> 
<br>
On the other hand, while liberating humans from certain knowledge tasks, it may prompt a reevaluation of our self-worth and a shift in the focus and scope of human education.
<br>
The following research directions are pivotal in addressing the changes brought by LLM in education and leveraging the opportunities:
<br>
1. Empowering Education with LLM: Harness the interdisciplinary knowledge, strong linguistic interaction, and low marginal cost inherent in LLM, <a href="https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/">address the lack of subject-matter expertise, content controllability, and quality consistency in LLM</a> to support The adoption of core competency education, its recognition by employers and society, and its democratization.
<br>
2. AI Computational Thinking Education: Assist individuals and organizations in understanding the capabilities and limitations of LLM. Pinpoint the roles and responsibilities in human-model collaboration. By abstracting and breaking down problems, designing and validating processes, and iterating based on feedback, we can harness LLM to solve existing issues or create new value.
